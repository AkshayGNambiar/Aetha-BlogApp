Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express
This is a RESTful API for managing a blog application. Users can register, log in, create, update, and delete blog posts.

Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

Controllers: Contains controller functions to handle requests.
Models: Contains Mongoose models for user and post entities.
Routes: Defines routes for handling HTTP requests.
Middleware: Contains middleware functions for authentication and request validation.
app.js: Main application file where Express is configured and routes are connected.
.env: Stores environment variables.
server.js: Entry point of the application

To create a README.md file for your project documentation, you can include information about the project structure, how to set it up, and how to use the provided functionality. Here's an example of what you can include:
